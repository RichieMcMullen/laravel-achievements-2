## Requirements

- Laravel 5.7
- PHP 7.2

The package supports the above versions, but may work on older or newer versions.

## Installation

Install the package via Composer.

```bash
composer require tehwave/laravel-achievements
```

Publish migrations.

```bash
php artisan vendor:publish --tag="achievements-migrations"
```

Migrate the migrations.

```bash
php artisan migrate
```

As an optional choice, you may publish config as well.

```bash
php artisan vendor:publish --tag="achievements-config"
```

## Usage

`Laravel Achievements` work much like Laravel's notifications.

### Creating Achievements

```bash
php artisan make:achievement UsersFirstPost
```

This command will place a fresh `Achievement` class in your new `app/Achievements` directory. Each `Achievement` class contains a `toDatabase` method, that you may use to store additional data with the achievement, and a couple of variables for meta information.

### Unlocking Achievements

Use `Achiever` trait on entities that can unlock achievements.

```php
<?php

namespace App;

use tehwave\Achievements\Traits\Achiever;

class User
{
    use Achiever;

    // ...
}
```

*Achieve* an achievement via the `achieve` method.

```php
$user = App\User::find(1);

$user->achieve(new \App\Achievements\UsersFirstPost());
```

...or use `Achievement` class to unlock achievements.

```php
$user = App\User::find(1);

tehwave\Achievements\Achievement::unlock($user, new \App\Achievements\UsersFirstPost());
```

### Accessing Achievements

Retrieve all of the entity's unlocked achievements.

```php
$user = App\User::find(1);

$user->achievements()->get();
```

## Tests

There are no tests for this package as I don't know how to write them.

However, the package is stable ~~enough~~ for a production environment. Case in point, I'm using it for [gm48.net](https://gm48.net), which is written in Laravel 5.7 and running on PHP 7.2.
